# 🌱 Python Module 00  

This project is part of the **42 School Common Core** and serves as an introduction to
**Python fundamentals**.

The goal of this module is to learn basic Python syntax and concepts such as:
- functions
- input and output
- variables and types
- conditional statements
- loops and recursion
- basic string manipulation
- type annotations

Each exercise consists of **a single function**, written according to the subject rules,
and tested using a provided `main.py` helper.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each exercise is placed in its own directory (`ex0` to `ex7`) and contains **only the
requested function(s)**, with no `main` program.

---

## 📌 Exercises Overview

### **Exercise 0 — Hello Garden**
Displays a welcome message.
- Introduces basic function definition and `print()`.

---

### **Exercise 1 — Garden Plot Area**
Asks for the length and width of a garden plot and prints its area.
- Introduces user input, integer conversion, and basic arithmetic.

---

### **Exercise 2 — Harvest Total**
Asks for harvest weights from three different days and prints the total.
- Practices addition and variable usage.

---

### **Exercise 3 — Plant Age Check**
Checks if a plant is ready to harvest based on its age.
- Introduces conditional logic (`if / else`).

---

### **Exercise 4 — Water Reminder**
Prints a reminder depending on how many days have passed since the last watering.
- Reinforces conditional statements and exact output formatting.

---

### **Exercise 5 — Count to Harvest**
Prints each day until harvest time using:
- an **iterative** approach
- a **recursive** approach

This exercise demonstrates the difference between loops and recursion.

---

### **Exercise 6 — Garden Summary**
Prints a simple summary of a garden using user-provided information.
- Combines multiple inputs into formatted output.

---

### **Exercise 7 — Seed Inventory**
Displays seed inventory information based on provided arguments and units.
- Introduces **function parameters**
- Uses **type annotations**
- Focuses on precise string formatting

---

## ✅ Notes

- All code follows **Python 3.10+** and **flake8** standards, as requested by 42 school.
- Outputs must match the subject examples exactly.
- This module focuses on clarity, correctness, and understanding rather than complexity.
