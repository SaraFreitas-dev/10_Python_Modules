# 🌿 Python Module 01 — Object-Oriented Garden Systems

This project is part of the **42 School Common Core** and focuses on
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.

Building on the fundamentals learned in **Module 00**, this module introduces
more structured and scalable programming concepts through the creation of a
**digital garden ecosystem**.

The goal of this module is to understand and apply:
- classes and objects
- instance methods
- class methods and static methods
- encapsulation and data protection
- inheritance and class hierarchies
- code organization and reuse
- nested helper classes
- basic system design and architecture

Each exercise incrementally builds on the previous one, resulting in a
cohesive and extensible system by the end of the module.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each exercise is placed in its own directory (`ex0` to `ex6`) and contains
only the files requested by the subject.

## 📌 Exercises Overview

### **Exercise 0 — Planting Your First Seed**
Introduces Python program structure and execution.
- Uses `if __name__ == "__main__"`
- Stores basic plant data
- Prints formatted output

**Concepts:** program entry point, variables, execution flow

---

### **Exercise 1 — Garden Data Organizer**
Introduces the first class-based design.
- Creates a `Plant` class
- Stores name, height, and age
- Manages multiple plant instances

**Concepts:** classes, objects, attributes

---

### **Exercise 2 — Plant Growth Simulator**
Adds behavior to plants.
- Reuses the `Plant` class
- Implements growth and aging
- Simulates changes over time

**Concepts:** instance methods, state changes

---

### **Exercise 3 — Plant Factory**
Focuses on object creation.
- Creates multiple plants efficiently
- Uses constructors (`__init__`)
- Displays structured output

**Concepts:** object initialization, reuse

---

### **Exercise 4 — Garden Security System**
Introduces data protection.
- Implements `SecurePlant`
- Protects data using validation
- Uses getters and setters

**Concepts:** encapsulation, data integrity

---

### **Exercise 5 — Specialized Plant Types**
Introduces inheritance.
- Base `Plant` class
- Specialized plant types
- Uses `super()` to reuse code

**Concepts:** inheritance, polymorphism

---

### **Exercise 6 — Garden Analytics Platform**
Combines all module concepts.
- Manages multiple gardens
- Uses a nested statistics helper
- Implements a plant hierarchy
- Calculates statistics and scores

**Concepts:** system design, nested classes, method types

---

## ✅ Notes

- Written for **Python 3.10+**
- Fully compliant with **flake8**
- Follows **42 naming conventions**
- Outputs match the subject examples exactly
