# Python Modules — Milestone 2 🐍

This repository contains my **Python modules for Milestone 2** of the **42 School
Common Core**.

These modules introduce Python progressively, starting from basic syntax and moving
towards more structured programming concepts. Each module is composed of multiple
exercises, designed to reinforce understanding through small, focused functions.

All modules follow the rules defined in their respective subjects:
- **Python 3.10+**
- No main programs unless explicitly allowed
- Exact output formatting
- Clean, readable, and standards-compliant code - **flake8**

## 📁 Content

of the Milestone 2 Python curriculum.

Each module:
- is organized in its own directory
- contains multiple exercises
- is tested using the provided helper tools
- is written according to 42 evaluation standards

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of these modules is to:
- build a solid foundation in Python
- understand core programming concepts
